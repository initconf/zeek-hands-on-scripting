[for all the exercise use: pcap which is named the same as zeek file]

We want to get familiar with: 

01-conn-record-preview.zeek
02-event-conn-state-remove.zeek
03-events-across-tcp-connection.zeek
04-conditional-checks.zeek
05-access-inside-conn-record.zeek
06-conn_attempt-vs-conn_established.zeek
07-creating-events-functions.zeek
08-scheduling-an-event.zeek

Exercises to do: 

Task 1: Calculate and print total bytes used by this connection ? 

    Hints:  (i) We will need to know the difference between events and what event fires when. 
                - look for difference between event new_connection vs event connection_state_remove  
	        (ii) What is the differece between orig_bytes & orig_ip_bytes and resp_bytes & resp_ip_bytes 
                which one would you pick to calculate total bytes
            (iii) Did you notice missed_bytes in conn.log ? 

Task 2: try zeek with 2-conn.pcap - What else do you see ? 

Task 3:  Why do different traces show different connection events triggering : 
	(i) zeek -r Traces/06-conn_attempt-vs-conn_established.pcap scripts/06-conn_attempt-vs-conn_established.zeek 
	(ii) zeek -r Traces/conn_attempt.pcap scripts/06-conn_attempt-vs-conn_established.zeek 
    (iii) Also compare history & conn_state fields for both runs.
