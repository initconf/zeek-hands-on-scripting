If you are familar with tables & sets may be attempt these questions: 

1) for each emote IP to how many uniq ports do you see ? 
2) for each remote IP to how many uniq dst IPs do you see ? 
3) for each remote IP to how many uniq ports do you see on each uniq destination ip ? 
4) extend expire_function to get periodicity ? 
5) tables-3-pair - experiment with read_expire and write_expire 

Extra-credits: 
5) can you calculate how many bytes each dst port has ? 
6) how many bytes each source IP has sent/received ? 

Extra-extra credits: 
7) can do you some math foo to find avg bytes and then 3 sigma varience for each remote IP  - ex. possibly used is ssh bruteforcer successful login attempt determination
8) You can probably do this with duration of connecitons too ? 


=========================
Problem 1) I would like to track how many connections does an IP address make ?
Problem 2) How many times have two hosts talked with each other in last hour ?
Problem 3) Can we build a list of all services on all hosts on the network ?
